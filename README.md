# Abstract
"In this paper, physical basics of brain potentials and
electroencephalography have been described. Systems that are used
in electroencephalography, with special emphasis on their structure
and modules, have been shown. This view has been further
illustrated with examples of commercial electroencephalographic
57devices. Afterwards, description of the system for ERP
measurements based on OPENEEG design, have been given. This
system has been used in the experimental measurements of the P300
signal, performed on 11 participants. Results of the measurements,
data processing and discussion have been stated."
